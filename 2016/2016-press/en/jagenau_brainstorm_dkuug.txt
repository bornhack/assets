A new big brother for the camp & co

The existing hack and camp arrangements in Denmark have become to small for some of the attendees.
After they have been to some of the big "nerd festivals" over Europe they decided to bring a similar event to Denmark.
They found a picturesque piece of land on Bornholom to rent, that belongs to the scouts and has potential to comfortably accomodate 500 happy campers and more. Bla bla fast internet...

Since they have been buzzing and things are looking good.  
During their active time in various open source projects and by being genuinly interested and passionate about the events they attended, 
they have built up a network, which is able to advise them on running a gathering of that scale.

The first talks and workshops have been announced and the Danish open source community can look forward to learn and exchange about topics ranging from * to *. All that alongside hygge and beer on the sun island. 
But there has been also quite some response from neighbouring countries, so it will be an international event. 
The talks and workshops will be held in English.
Bornhack has a reasonable expectation of seeing 100 - 200 people this first time. The event is planned to be yearly recurring, so this year's success will set pace for years to come.
