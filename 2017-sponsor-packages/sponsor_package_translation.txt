BornHack 2017 Sponsor Packages

BornHack is a unique event in Denmark where leading experts from many different areas meet. This makes it the perfect venue for both employees and management to discuss and use new technologies.

We encourage sponsors to submit a device, challenge, or question to be solved or explored. There will be plenty of time to talk things through, and the organizers will be happy to make contact with just the experts you might need.

In case you're looking to hire passionate people with a strong technical profile, BornHack has a high concentration of specialists participating all 7 days. All sponsors get access to our recruitment area.

BornHack is also a fantastic place for teambuilding while expanding your employees and colleagues competences. The event provides ample opportunity to build knowledge, get to know each other and have a lot of fun.

If you have a product to sell, bring your swag and discount codes and distribute them among our attendees.
