\noindent {\raggedleft \textbf{BornHack} is an annual 7 day outdoor tent camp
where hackers, makers and other people with an interest in technology and society
come together to celebrate technology, socialise, learn and \textbf{have fun}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We are preparing BornHack 2019 which will take place
from \textbf{8th to 15th of August 2019}, at our new venue on the Danish island
of \textbf{Funen}. BornHack 2019 will be built on the success and experience
from our first three events in 2016, 2017, and 2018, aiming to grow and extend
the great traditions that have emerged.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We will organise interesting, high quality talks and
workshops. But BornHack is a \textbf{participatory} event, so we've come to
expect participants and villages to come up with ideas and projects as well.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You can keep yourself updated on our website at
\textbf{https://bornhack.dk} or \textbf{http://bornhack7hctgpio.onion}.
Remember to check it out frequently for news about the event, ticket sales
and speakers. You can also follow us on Twitter using \textbf{@bornhax}}.\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You are welcome to ask questions and show your
interest on IRC at \textbf{\#bornhack} on \textbf{irc.baconsvin.org}
(\textbf{6nbtgccn5nbcodn3.onion}), using TLS on port 6697. Let us know if
you have an idea that would be fun, educational, interesting or provocative
to do. We also need volunteers for different areas of the event, our website
has more information on the available teams.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We hope you want to be a part of BornHack!}\\

\noindent Sincerely\\
The BornHack Team
