\noindent {\raggedleft \textbf{Bornhack} is a 7 day outdoor camp
where hackers, makers and people with an interest in technology and
security come together to celebrate technology, socialise, learn
and \textbf{have fun}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft It takes place for the first time from
\textbf{August 27 to September 3rd 2016} on the Danish island
\textbf{Bornholm} where we have found the geography as well as
backbone to make it happen.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft Bornhack is a \textbf{participatory} event
where we expect people to come up with crazy ideas and help make
the content. We will reach out to people to ensure interesting,
high quality talks and workshops.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We will continuously be updating our website
\textbf{https://bornhack.dk} (\textbf{http://bornhack7hctgpio.onion/}).
Remember to check it frequently to keep yourself updated.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You are also very welcome to ask questions
and show your interest on IRC at \textbf{\#bornhack} on
\textbf{irc.baconsvin.org} (\textbf{6nbtgccn5nbcodn3.onion}),
using TLS on port 6697. That  way you can help us understand what
you think would be fun to do. This is a new event, so we don't
yet know exactly where this is going -- but give us your feedback
and you can help us form it.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We hope you want to be a part of Bornhack.}\\

\noindent Sincerely\\
The Bornhack Team
