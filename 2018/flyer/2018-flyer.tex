\noindent {\raggedleft \textbf{BornHack} is an annually 7 day outdoor tent camp
where hackers, makers and other people with an interest in technology and society
come together to celebrate technology, socialise, learn and \textbf{have fun}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We are preparing BornHack 2018 which
will take place from \textbf{16th to 23rd of August 2018}, returning to
the beautiful nature on the Danish island of \textbf{Bornholm}. 2018 will be
built on the success from our first two events in 2016 and 2017, aiming to
grow and extend the great traditions we've created. 

\noindent {\raggedleft We will organise interesting, high quality talks and
workshops. But BornHack is a \textbf{participatory} event, so we expect
participants and villages to come up with ideas and projects as well.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You can keep yourself updated on our website at
\textbf{https://bornhack.dk} or \textbf{http://bornhack7hctgpio.onion}.
Remember to check it out frequently for news about the event, ticket sales
and speakers. You can also follow us on Twitter using \textbf{@bornhax}}.\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You are welcome to ask questions and show your
interest on IRC at \textbf{\#bornhack} on \textbf{irc.baconsvin.org}
(\textbf{6nbtgccn5nbcodn3.onion}), using TLS on port 6697. Let us know if
you have an idea that would be fun, educational, interesting or provocative
to do. We also need volunteers for different areas of the event, our website
has more information on the available teams.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We hope you want to be a part of BornHack!}\\

\noindent Sincerely\\
The BornHack Team
