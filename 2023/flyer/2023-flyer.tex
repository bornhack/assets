\noindent {\raggedleft \textbf{BornHack} is an annual 7 day outdoor tent camp
where hackers, makers and other people with an interest in technology and society
come together to celebrate technology, socialise, learn and \textbf{have fun}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We are preparing BornHack 2023 which will take place
from \textbf{2nd to 9th of August 2023} at our venue on the Danish island
of \textbf{Funen}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We will organise interesting, high quality talks and
workshops. But BornHack is a \textbf{participatory} event, so we rely on
participants and villages to come up with their own ideas and projects as well.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You can keep yourself updated on our website at
\textbf{https://bornhack.dk} or
\textbf{http://nclpuewtqbrtgnugfquprohygp2ni2idinfrbmiptxrp6d6uvtctpyid.onion/}}.\\

event, ticket sales and speakers. You can also follow us on Twitter using

using TLS on port 6697. Let us know if you have an idea that would be fun,
educational, interesting or provocative to do. We also need volunteers for
many different areas of the event, our website has more information on the
