\noindent {\raggedleft \textbf{BornHack} is an annual 7 day outdoor tent camp
where hackers, makers and other people with an interest in technology and society
come together to celebrate technology, socialise, learn and \textbf{have fun}.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We are preparing BornHack 2020 which will take place
from \textbf{11th to 18th of August 2020} at our new venue on the Danish island
of \textbf{Funen}. BornHack 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the event.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We will organise interesting, high quality talks and
workshops. But BornHack is a \textbf{participatory} event, so we rely on
participants and villages to come up with their own ideas and projects as well.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You can keep yourself updated on our website at
\textbf{https://bornhack.dk} or \textbf{http://bornhack7hctgpio.onion}.
Remember to check it out frequently for news about the event, ticket sales
and speakers. You can also follow us on Twitter using \textbf{@bornhax}}.\\

\noindent {\raggedleft You are welcome to ask questions and show your
interest on IRC at \textbf{\#bornhack} on \textbf{irc.baconsvin.org}
(\textbf{6nbtgccn5nbcodn3.onion}), using TLS on port 6697. Let us know if
you have an idea that would be fun, educational, interesting or provocative
to do. We also need volunteers for many different areas of the event, our website
has more information on the available teams.}\\

\noindent {\raggedleft We hope you want to be a part of BornHack!}\\

\noindent Sincerely\\
The BornHack Team
