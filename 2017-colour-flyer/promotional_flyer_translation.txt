Background
BornHack is a 7 day hacker festival on the Danish island of Bornholm. The idea for BornHack was originally developed during a smaller Danish IT summer camp.
The organisers are employed in Danish and international IT jobs and a good part of the groups knowledge and expertise has been gathered through participation in hacker camps throughout Europe.
Thus BornHack was started in 2016 to become the natural Nordic meeting place for hackers, makers and anyone with an interest in technology and society.
Being a festival BornHack offers great opportunities for socialising and the lovely rural countryside of Bornholm lends the ideal backdrop for the event.


Purpose
BornHack aims to be a non-profit event where hackers, makers, and people with an interest in technology, development and society can meet to share, create, teach and learn.
This type of event focussed on socialising over several days is already popular in other countries. BornHack aims to build on that popularity.
The attendees expand their network, discuss new technologies and the resulting challenges and possibilities in depth and take a world of inspiration home to their friends, workplaces, and companies.
